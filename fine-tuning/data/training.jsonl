IF MEAN SHIFTED (centering issue):\n- Tool wear: Progressive shift in one direction is classic tool wear signature. Check tool life tracking.\n- Fixture drift: Workholding reference surface worn. Measure fixture with CMM.\n- Material change: New material lot with different machinability. Check material certs.\n- Compensation error: CNC offset incorrectly adjusted. Review offset history.\n\n3. IF VARIATION INCREASED (spread issue):\n- Tool condition: Chipped or worn insert causes inconsistent cutting. Inspect tool under magnification.\n- Spindle bearing wear: Increased runout from bearing degradation. Check spindle runout.\n- Thermal effects: Seasonal temperature changes in shop. Monitor machine and ambient temperature.\n- Coolant degradation: Concentration, contamination, or flow changes. Test coolant.\n- Fixture clamping: Inconsistent clamping force.

ANODIZE LAYER THICKNESS VARIATION (25%):\n- Thicker anodize = darker color (more pore volume absorbs more dye)\n- Type II spec: 18-25um. Variation within range causes visible color difference.\n- Causes: Current density variation, temperature fluctuation, rack contact quality\n- Action: Standardize anodize time and current density. Target consistent 20um thickness. Verify with eddy current probe.\n\n3. SEAL PROCESS VARIATION (20%):\n- Hot water seal temperature and time affect final color\n- Under-seal: Dye can leach out, lighter color\n- Over-seal: Color shift toward gray\n- Nickel acetate seal temperature: 95-100C for 15-20 min\n- Action: Verify seal bath temperature with calibrated thermometer, standardize immersion time\n\n4. ALLOY AND TEMPER VARIATION (10%):\n- Different aluminum alloys anodize differently even within same family\n- 6061-T6 vs 6063-T5 will show different color even in same bath\n- Silicon content affects color: Higher Si = darker/grayer appearance\n- Action: Segregate alloys in processing, establish separate process recipes per alloy\n\n5.

CONTACT METHOD (physical shape prevents error):\n- Asymmetric features: Connectors that only fit one way (USB-C vs micro-USB example)\n- Guide pins: Fixture pins that prevent wrong orientation\n- Shaped cutouts: Component only fits in correct position\n- Example: Assembly fixture with locating pins matching part holes. Part cannot be placed upside down.\n\n2. FIXED-VALUE METHOD (ensures correct quantity):\n- Part presenters: Bin with exactly the right number of fasteners for one assembly\n- Counter-based tools: Torque wrench with cycle counter, prevents skipping bolts\n- Light-guided assembly: Pick-to-light illuminates correct bin in sequence\n- Example: Shadow board with cutouts for each component. Missing part is immediately visible.\n\n3. MOTION-STEP METHOD (ensures correct sequence):\n- Interlocked steps: Next station does not activate until previous step verified\n- Sensor sequence: Proximity sensors verify each step completed in order\n- Software lock: Assembly software requires confirmation at each step\n- Example: Barcode scan sequence - must scan component barcode before tool activates.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STEPS:\n\n1. IDENTIFY ERROR MODES:\n- Review PFMEA for high-risk manual operations\n- Analyze defect history: What are the top 5 assembly errors?\n- Observe operators: Where do they hesitate, backtrack, or make corrections?\n- Focus on: Wrong part, wrong orientation, missing part, wrong sequence, wrong torque\n\n2. DESIGN POKA-YOKE:\n- For each error mode, choose prevention over detection\n- Keep it simple: Mechanical solutions before electronic\n- Cost target: Less than 10% of cost of one defect escape\n- Involve operators in design (they know the failure modes best)\n\n3. VALIDATE:\n- Test with deliberate errors: Try to build it wrong. The poka-yoke must prevent or catch it.\n- Test with operators: Does it slow production unacceptably?\n- Failure mode: What happens if the poka-yoke device itself fails? (Fail-safe design)\n\n4.

DEFINE OBJECTIVE AND RESPONSES:\nResponses to measure:\n- Tensile strength (destructive test, target >480 MPa for S355 steel)\n- Penetration depth (macro cross-section, target 1.5-3.0mm)\n- Bead geometry (width, reinforcement height, uniformity)\n- Porosity level (visual and X-ray, target <2%)\n- Distortion (dimensional measurement before/after)\n\n2. SELECT FACTORS AND LEVELS:\n\nFactor A - Wire feed speed (WFS):\n- Low: 6 m/min\n- Mid: 8 m/min\n- High: 10 m/min\n\nFactor B - Travel speed:\n- Low: 300 mm/min\n- Mid: 450 mm/min\n- High: 600 mm/min\n\nFactor C - Voltage:\n- Low: 22V\n- Mid: 25V\n- High: 28V\n\nFactor D - Contact tip to work distance (CTWD):\n- Low: 12mm\n- High: 18mm\n\nHeld constant: Gas (80/20 Ar/CO2), wire (ER70S-6 1.0mm), position (flat)\n\n3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:\n\nScreening phase (identify significant factors):\n- 2^4 fractional factorial (Resolution IV): 8 runs + 3 center points = 11 runs\n- This identifies which factors significantly affect each response\n- Analyze with Pareto chart of effects and main effects plots\n\nOptimization phase (find optimal settings):\n- Central Composite Design (CCD) on significant factors\n- If 3 factors significant: 20 runs (8 factorial + 6 axial + 6 center)\n- Generate response surface model\n- Find optimal settings using desirability function\n\n4. EXECUTION:\n- Randomize run order completely (do not run in sequence)\n- Use same material batch for all runs\n- Same operator for all runs\n- Allow parts to cool to same temperature between runs\n- Prepare all test coupons identically (same cleaning, fit-up, tacking)\n- Record all actual parameter values (not just set values)\n- Cut 3 cross-sections per run for destructive testing\n\n5. ANALYSIS:\n- ANOVA to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05)\n- Main effects plots to see direction of each factor\n- Interaction plots to identify factor dependencies\n- Response surface plots for optimization\n- Confirmation runs: 3 runs at predicted optimal settings\n- Verify predictions match actual results within confidence interval\n\n6. EXPECTED OUTCOMES:\n- Wire feed speed and travel speed are typically the most significant factors\n- Voltage primarily affects bead width and penetration\n- Optimal heat input range: 0.8-1.5 kJ/mm for 6mm carbon steel\n- Document optimal parameters in WPS (Welding Procedure Specification)\n\nTIME AND COST: Approximately 25 test coupons, 2-3 days of welding and testing. Cost of knowledge far outweighs cost of production defects."}]}

Incoming: NDT (dimensional, visual) + DT (hardness sample, tensile sample per lot)\n2. In-process: NDT (dimensional, visual, SPC) + DT (first-piece hardness after heat treat)\n3. Final: NDT (100% dimensional, visual, NDT per code) + DT (sample per lot)\n4.

DT tells you the material and process are fundamentally capable."}]}
